# Serverless-web-hosting - hosting serverless website on AWS

The cost of hosting website has gone up over the years, making it difficuilt for businesses to have online presence. AWS has made that easy and cheap for us through the serverless offering where you only pay for the API calls done to your website, even then after a certain number of calls have been made, usually over the 1 million mark.

With this example, since it is a static website, there are API calls on the site, the cost to have the site online is close to $0, only cost was registering domain, which cost around $14.00 + Tax.

Prerequisites:
- Website template designed in HTML, CSS and Javascript. If you do not have website development skill, you can hire a developer to do it for you.
- AWS Account Service Configuration: S3 for object storage, Cloudfront for content distribution, ACM for certificate management, Route 53 to register domain.
- Doamin registration fee.
